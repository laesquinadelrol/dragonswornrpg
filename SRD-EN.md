## CHARACTER CREATION

### MAIN STATS

Your **Player Character** (PC) has 3 **Stats**:

●        **Strength**: Used for Saves requiring brawn, toughness or physical power

●        **Dexterity**: Used for Saves requiring poise, reflexes or speed

●        **Presence**: Used for Saves requiring charisma, sageness or willpower

 To determine your PC’s Stats: roll three d6s once, compare the value of each die against the following table, then add +1 to the corresponding Stat. All three scores must add up to 3.

|   1-2    |    3-4    |   5-6    |
| :------: | :-------: | :------: |
| Strength | Dexterity | Presence |

> *e.g. Oliver rolled [3][5][6], the first die adds + 1 to Dexterity, and then the second and third dice both add +1 to Presence, for a total of Strength 0, Dexterity 1, and Presence 2.*

### SECONDARY STATS

**Base Value** is a number to generate your PC's **Health** and their **Target Number** (TN). Roll d6+6 to determine your PC's Base Value. 

TN is a value that is determined from the sum of the character’s Base Value and the current Stat that you will be used to Save.

**Health** is your PC's vital force. If it is reduced to zero, your PC dies. Health is equal to the character's base value + [Strength].

 **Courage** reflects a character’s ability to avoid getting hurt and suffering stress. Courage is equal to 1d6 + [Dexterity + Presence].

### INVENTORY

Your PC has 10 slots + [Strength] of **Inventory**. Only they can hold 2 weapons and 2 Armor. **Bulky Items** take up two slots. Your PC cannot carry more than three Bulky Items.

Your character starting with one random equipment package (example below)

> *E.g. three days rations, exploring gear, climbing gear, brigandine (1 armor, bulky), helmet (+1 armor), long sword (d10 damage, bulky), and Magic Artifact.*

> |  5   |                                                              |
> |  6   |                                                              |



### FINISHING TOUCHES

Name your PC, and write some **Traits** (e. g. background, virtue, vice, etc.).

## RULES

### SAVES

A Save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky actions and situations (even in combat maneuvers). When making a Save, go through the following: 

1. Roll two d20s.

2. Each d20 that is equal to or under your TN scores a single **success**, and each die that rolled 1 is a **Critical Success** that scores two successes instead of one.

3. For each die above your TN, you score a single failure. If you rolled a 19 or 20, you score a **Critical Failure** and it means that you automatically **Fail** the Save, regardless of the number of successes rolled.

4. Interpreting your results:

   - *2+ successes* are a **Strong Hit**. You avoid any bad consequences.

   - *1 success is* a **Weak Hit**. You partially avoid any bad consequence, but with a cost or lesser effect.

   - *2+ failures* are a **Fail**. You will face any bad consequences of your actions, or must make serious concessions.

### ENCUMBRANCE & BULKY ITEMS

If your PC is carrying their full inventory or carries more than 3 bulky items, their Courage is reduced to zero

### DEPRIVED

A PC deprived of a crucial need, such as food or rest, is unable to recover Courage.

### HEALING & REST

A fifteen-minute break will restore the PC's full Courage but leave the PC exposed to danger. Recovering Health requires magical assistance or a week of rest and the help of a healer.

### ARMORS

Each armor grants between 1 and 3 armor points for protection. No one can have more than 3 armor.

## COMBAT

In the next combat rules, when an attacker or target is indicated, it refers to both the PC and the opponent

### INITIATIVE

Starting combat, your PC’s make a Dexterity Save to act first. 

### TURNS

During the attacker’s turn, they can move and take one action.

### ATTACKING & DAMAGE

Describe the attacker’s action, roll their **Weapon Die** (d6, d8, or d10), and subtracts the target’s armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s Courage. Damage that reduces a target’s Courage below zero decreases a target’s Health by the remaining amount.

When the target's Health decreases, they must make a Strength Save to avoid a **Critical Wound**, which means they are out of combat. They will need help to survive, or they will die within the hour. Otherwise, if the target hit the Save, they suffer an annoying scar in the fiction, but continue in the fray.

**Advantage Attacks** always do d12 damage, and **D****isadvantage Attacks** always do d4. This is independent of the attacker’s Weapon Dice. **Unarmed Attacks** always do d4 damage.

### MULTIPLE ATTACKERS

If multiple attackers target the same opponent, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## MAGIC ARTIFACTS

**Magic Artifacts** have an imbued spell. Roll two d40s on Tables below to create one spell with its effect from two prompt words.

Magical attacks do d8 damage, although you may have to use a different die (d6 or d10) depending on the circumstances.

Anyone can activate the Magic Artifact once a day, as a normal action, by holding it in two hands and saying the magic words. If the PC is deprived or in danger, make Presence Save.

## GROWTH

After fulfilling a quest, roll 1d6 and add to Courage. New skills are only learned in fiction with specialists.

## ORACLE

The Oracle is like a Save, but TN is equal to 10+Probability (+2 if likely, +1 if otherwise, +0 if unlikely). Rolled 19 or 20 is always a Fail.

- **Strong Hit**: Yes, and…
- **Weak Hit**: Yes, but…
- **Fail**: No

## CONVERTING MONSTERS

- Stats: +0 is below average, +1 is average, +2 is above average and +3 is highest.
- 1 Courage per HD: give average creature 3, hardy ones 6, and serious threats get 10+.
- Health is equal to monster's Strength.
